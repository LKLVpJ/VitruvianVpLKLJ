Would you like to proceed with refining or implementing any specific components of this theorem?Sure, here's a sample email that you can use as a starting point:\n\nSubject: Potential Partnership for a Secure Data Sharing Platform\n\nDear Heigo,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out to you about a potential idea that I think could benefit from your expertise in electrical engineering. I have been developing a concept for a secure data sharing platform that utilizes modular arithmetic and a unique handshake process to ensure that only trusted devices have access to the shared data.\n\nThe platform would allow for three devices to connect and share data securely, and any additional devices seeking access would have to connect with one of the existing three devices to form a new group. The system would rely on each device generating a unique number that is only known by the members of the group, and any changes to that number would result in access being denied.\n\nAdditionally, each device would pick a random number of either one or two, except for the trusted device which is always two. The trusted device would then multiply the final number by the target device's number, the device seeking connection's number, and the trusted device's number, to ensure that only authorized devices can access the shared data.\n\nI believe that this idea has significant potential to provide a secure and reliable data sharing platform for a variety of industries, and I would love to discuss it further with you. I think that your background in electrical engineering would be a valuable asset in developing this idea and potentially bringing it to market.\n\nPlease let me know if you are interested in discussing this idea further, and if so, we can set up a time to talk in more detail.\n\nBest regards
